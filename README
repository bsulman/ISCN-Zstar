Code and data files for ISCN depth profile (Z*) analysis

This code is meant to run on ISCN Gen3 data files: https://iscn.fluxdata.org/data/access-data/database-reports/
You will need to download these files for the scripts to function.
Please see the ISCN data use policy

NOTE: You will need to update data directories in the scripts for them to work on your machine

Python scripts were tested on a Mac using python 3.7.
Dependencies include:
pandas 0.25.0
numpy 1.16.4
matplotlib 3.1.1
cartopy 0.17.0
statsmodels 0.10.2


Code files:
zstarscript_ISCN_Gen3.py: Calculates the depth parameters (Z*, Cs, Zmax, Cdeep) on the raw ISCN Gen3 data
zstar_analysis.py: Generates plots and general analysis for the manuscript based on the profile fitting results and associated data
Sulman stats.R: Additional stats on the analysis

Data files:
piecewise_Cstock_combined.csv: Depth profile fitting results using SOC density (mass C per unit volume) data in each layer
piecewise_pctC_combine.csv: Depth profile fitting results using SOC concentration (%C) data in each layer
profiledata_gen3_with_climate_and_nlcd.csv: Profile-level ISCN data, including land cover and climate data
profiledata_stats_bins_Ap_20190624.csv: Profile-level ISCN data, with results of depth profile analysis (Z* stats, binning, etc) included. 
                                        *** This dataset has been filtered to only include profiles with Z* fits with R2>0.9 ***
