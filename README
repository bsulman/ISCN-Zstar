Code and data files for ISCN depth profile (Z*) analysis

This code is meant to run on ISCN Gen3 data files: https://iscn.fluxdata.org/data/access-data/database-reports/
You will need to download these files for the scripts to function.
Please see the ISCN data use policy

NOTE: You will need to update data directories in the scripts for them to work on your machine

Python scripts were tested on a Mac using python 3.7.
Dependencies include:
pandas 0.25.0
numpy 1.16.4
matplotlib 3.1.1
cartopy 0.17.0
statsmodels 0.10.2


Code files:
zstarscript_ISCN_Gen3.py: Calculates the depth parameters (Z*, Cs, Zmax, Cdeep) on the raw ISCN Gen3 data
zstar_analysis.py: Generates plots and general analysis for the manuscript based on the profile fitting results and associated data
Sulman stats.R: Additional stats on the analysis

Data files:
C[1-4]_Cstock_piecewise.csv: Depth profile fitting results using SOC density (mass C per unit volume) data in each layer. C1-4 correspond to divisions in the ISCN summary files and can be combined into a full dataset.
C[1-4]_pctC_piecewise.csv: Depth profile fitting results using SOC concentration (%C) data in each layer. C1-4 correspond to divisions in the ISCN summary files and can be combined into a full dataset.
C[1-4]_Cstock_piecewise_failed.csv: Depth profiles for which the fitting failed, with the reason the fit failed.
C[1-4]_pctC_piecewise_failed.csv: Depth profiles for which the fitting failed, with the reason the fit failed.
profiledata_gen3_with_climate_and_nlcd.csv: Profile-level ISCN data, including land cover and climate data
alldata_filtered_r2_90.csv: Data used in the main analysis, filtered to remove fits with R2<0.9 along with other criteria as described in the manuscript.
alldata_filtered_r2_75.csv: Data used in the version of the analysis filtered to remove fits with R2<0.75 instead of 0.9.
alldata_filtered_onlyOC_r2_90.csv: Data used in the version of the analysis that only used organic carbon data. The R2 threshold for this version of the analysis was 0.9.
